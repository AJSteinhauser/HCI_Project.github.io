# MILESTONE 3

[Discussion Video](https://youtu.be/8W0x4gKHio0)

### Breakdown proposed solutions into related user stories

1. As a student...
	1. ___I would like to formulate my thoughts on a discussion question before other students give their answer so I am able to process the question and come up with my own thoughts.___
	2. I would like to access previous discussions so that I can reflect on the ideas discussed in class after the discussion. 
	3. I would like my responses to be displayed to the class so that we can discuss my ideas as a group.
	4. ___I would like to be able to respond anonymously to the discussion so that I can feel more comfortable sharing my ideas with the class.___


2. As a teacher...
	1. ___I would like discussions to be organized and visually presented well so that there is little “user friction” in continuing discussions___
	2. I would like to remove posts that are inappropriate or irrelevant in order to maintain the integrity of the discussion.
	3. I would like to emphasize certain posts/ideas so that other students can refer to and respond to them.
	4. I would like to access previous discussions so that I can reflect on the ideas discussed in class after the discussion.
	5. I would like to allow all students a chance to feel comfortable discussing their ideas, so the classroom gets more diverse answers rather than a small group always answering.
	6. I would like to be able to randomize which responses may appear to the class so that I have an easy way to facilitate discussion without eliciting bias.
	7. ___I would like to be able to facilitate discussion in a variety of methods depending on the situation and nature of the topic.___

### Provide a justification and evidence

* 1.1 As a student, I would like to formulate my thoughts on a discussion question before other students give their answer so I am able to process the question and come up with my own thoughts.
	* This user story was chosen because it exemplifies our efforts to get students more comfortable in an in person discussion and affords students time to formulate their thoughts. Our goal is to lower conformity of student answers and give people time to plan and specify what the action of their goal will be. The plan and specify phase of the seven stages of action are some of those we identified as breaking down and this user story is set to give students more time for this. We believe this will then lead to higher completion and a better bridge of evaluation for the goal of student participation.
* 1.4 As a student, I would like to be able to respond anonymously to the discussion so that I can feel more comfortable sharing my ideas with the class.
	* This user story was chosen because of its relation to one of the main topics in our problem statement. Oftentimes small groups of students will dominate the entire classroom discussion and many individuals do not want to interject in fear of being publicly wrong. By having the option for the student to submit their post anonymously, this will make the student feel more comfortable in sharing their true thoughts and opinions. Many students will often wait for validation before feeling confident in answering a question (Mattick). Validation is constantly crucial to students' performance and can form a lot of negative anxious thoughts around participating in class activities (Cohen). We also included the option for students who feel comfortable enough to attach their name to their discussion post as well.
* 2.1 As a teacher, I would like discussions to be organized and visually presented well so that there is little “user friction” in continuing discussions.
	* This user story is important because if the user friction is mitigated during the discussion, it allows the students to focus all their attention on forming their thoughts and understanding what others have to say about the discussion topic. A platform like Piazza has a very complicated interface that creates a lot of interaction friction. Crucial buttons and settings are hidden away and are easily lost in the crowded UI. In this environment, it can be difficult for teachers to facilitate discussions in ways that make it clear to the students what is expected of them and how to produce the desired responses. By presenting the discussion topics alone on screen to the students and allowing the teacher to browse and select certain responses at any time, our interface affords the clear and concise setting of expectations and focused discussion. 
* 2.6 As a teacher, I would like to be able to randomize which responses may appear to the class so that I have an easy way to facilitate discussion without eliciting bias.
	* This user story represents our goal to create a discussion experience that minimizes monopolization of conversation by certain students to allow every student a chance to have their responses heard and discussed. We would like the instructor's side of the interface to afford easy facilitation of these discussions via the ability to randomize which responses appear to the class. This eliminates any bias and allows for an open discussion.

We believe that user story 1.1 was the most important to our design because it had many of the features needed that we dove into researching in our previous milestone. Much of the research we did was around giving students more comfort in classroom discussions. We found that there is a positive trend in the relationship between social anxiety and discomfort in a discussion based class with a p-value < 0.001 (Cohen).  This led us to choosing this design of allowing students time to formulate their thoughts and take time to construct their answers without others influence.

We earlier found, “Normative influence leads people to conform because they fear the consequence of rejection that follows deviance.” (Asch) and we believe this design will allow students to create thoughts without feeling the social judgement of others one may face. One design decision we decided to change was making sure students would not see other answers before submitting their own. On some discussion forms like Piazza, you are able to see all other answers and we wanted our design to cut down on this conformity to make sure all students have original thoughts in their discussion.

Another design decision we made is a simplistic interface. We wanted to make sure that students did not feel overwhelmed by what the UI had to offer and instead felt a sense of comfort in using it to answer their questions. In this user story it truly puts students first and that is what we are trying to solve. Making students more comfortable in a discussion class and giving them the tools to succeed is what we believe this user story can do.
