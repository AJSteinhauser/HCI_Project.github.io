## Research 

### Research Question

How can current features included in in-class discussion software tools, such as Piazza and TopHat, be improved to help limit social anxiety and conformity, while encouraging the student to participate in the discussion openly and honestly? 

### Methodology

In order to test our application, we decided to use mixed methods so that we can collect both quantitative and qualitative data. We will conduct an observational experiment followed by a questionnaire. This combination will hopefully provide information to understand if our application truly helps students to feel more comfortable sharing their opinions during a class discussion. Not only is it important to observe the responses of students during the discussion using the application, but it is also important to collect feedback after the fact. 


### Observational Experiment 

For the observational experiment, we plan to have two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The participants will consist of different sections of the same class. The goal would be to test our application in a class where discussion happens often, such as an ethics course or even Cotterell’s HCI class. This will ensure that students have already participated in a discussion and will not be surprised when we carry out our own. We will randomly decide which sections from the same course will be the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group will use our application during the discussion, whereas the control group will use their normal platform used for discussions, such as Piazza or TopHat. We will keep the discussion question consistent for both the experimental group and control group for all sections being tested. 		

### Questionnaire/Survey

After conducting the observational study, we will also ask each participant to fill out a survey or questionnaire to receive feedback about their experience. We will ask different questions regarding the ease of use of the application and how they felt in sharing their responses. Additionally, for the experimental group, we will include some questions specific to the software for the participants to provide feedback on their experience using it in class. For example, we will have the participants rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how easy the application was to use overall, with 10 being the easiest. For the main survey, we might ask how comfortable they were in sharing their opinion on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most comfortable. Asking these types of questions will help us to gain quantitative data to analyze the overall experience of the participants. We will also include an open ended question where the participants can write both positive and negative aspects about the experience and if they have any ideas for improvements. We think it is also important to have the participants rank different features included in the application to understand more about the actual user experience of the application. For example, we will have the participants rank the importance of having the choice to decide if they want to remain anonymous or attach their name to their response to see if this feature included in our application actually made a difference in their experience.


### Testing Procedures and Analysis

Since the study will take place in a classroom at the university of Georgia, we will adhere to the same Covid-19 safety guidelines put in place by the University. We will recommend that everyone wear masks, and any researchers in the room will be masked. For our testing procedure, we will ensure that every student participant understands the nature of our study and has agreed to participate by having them sign the informed consent form below.

Each group will participate in a discussion based class period; the experimental group will use our software, and the control will not. We will save the students' responses and make note of any differences in willingness to share their opinions openly. After the period, we will also collect data from the students via survey. The survey will provide both quantitative and qualitative data, which will allow us to analyze any differences in responses from the control group and experimental group. An example of the survey is shown below. 

#### Experimental Survey

#### Control Survey

After receiving the completed surveys, we will compile the data and analyze the impact our software had on the students' experience in their discussion based classrooms. We will be looking for a decrease in stress levels and an increase in engagement, comfort, and overall quality of the discussion between groups. We will examine the numerical responses given for each question and generate a five number summary for each question (consisting of the smallest number, the first quartile, median, third quartile, and largest number), in addition to the mean. Using this data, we can determine the difference in the overall trends between the two groups.
