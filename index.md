## Project Description

_AJ Steinhauser, Aaron Daughtery, Caroline Lewis, Andino Rochan_

When in discussion-based in-person classes it is often the same group of students giving their opinions, which can lead to students conforming to other answers based on their peers' responses. Students are often not given time to own their individual thoughts before being called on and can feel as if their opinion is not significant to the discussion. Many students will often wait for validation before feeling confident in answering an opinion-based question. While there are anonymous discussion boards for out of class there are no good tools to facilitate live discussion in face-to-face learning.

This is a goal of this project is to directly address this issue by designing an interface that promotes lively discussion in class. We will primarily designing this system by looking at already existing interfaces and designing a new system that takes the best aspects of these systems and designs alternative methods where these interfaces fail.
