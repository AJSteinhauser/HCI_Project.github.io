In this milestone, we discuss our current problem with evidence to back up claims we make about discussion based classroom participation. This page will first take you through a researched problem defininition and what potential users it effects. We discuss the issues with in class participation within a discussion based class and how students anxiety and lack of validation is not facilitated through any current technologies. We then discribe existing solutions such as Piazza, Tophat, and eLC to explore where they break down in the Seven stages of Action. Lastly, we propose a solution to solve our problem and discuss how we can measure its success.

## A. Task and Problem Definition

**Problem Introduction**

Discussion based classes are prevalent throughout schools and universities and are an effective environment for education. However, these settings do not always afford easy and open communication, and some students can sometimes struggle to find effective ways to share their thoughts and contribute to the discussion. This can result in uninvolvement or conformity to the ideas of whoever answers first or those who monopolize the conversation, which can lead to an incomplete dialogue and false inflation of certain perspectives.  

The theoretical framework coined with the term “Seven Stages of Action” can be used to help understand human behavior more easily and allows for investigation of where in these seven stages there is a lack within current standards (Scott). These actions begin with a goal. In the problem stated, contributing to the class discussion is the goal for a student. In the bridge of execution, many steps start to break down and create barriers for the student to execute their goal. There is a positive trend in the relationship between social anxiety and discomfort in a discussion based class with a p-value < 0.001 (Cohen).

Looking at this trend, it is obvious that oftentimes when given the choice to speak many students who feel discomfort will stay silent. This is where the plan and specific phases within the Seven Stages of Action breaks down. When students are put on the spot with a question to the class the plan to answer the questions gets bogged down with the anxiety of being wrong or not being validated. Many students will often wait for validation before feeling confident in answering a question (Mattick). Validation is constantly crucial to students' performance and can form a lot of negative anxious thoughts around participating in class activities (Cohen). Currently the existing technical solutions that exist to facilitate class discussion breakdown within this phase.

After a student has gone through the plan and specify phases of the Seven Stages of Action, they will go on to perform the goal action. The perform phase is also a phase with high likelihood of breaking down with the lack of modern facilitation in some discussion. There are typically three outcomes when students are asked a question. A student will either contribute to discussion, stay silent, or conform to others' answers. “Normative influence leads people to conform because they fear the consequence of rejection that follows deviance.” (Asch). Conformity is another major issue within discussion based learning and it is often seen that students will conform to an answer they do not agree with because they fear being incorrect (Cohen). In a study done by Solomon Asch, participants would be asked a non trivial question of which line was longer. When they were alone they would answer the questions with 100% accuracy, but when a participant was put with a group of confederates told to give incorrect answers the participant would give the wrong answer as well about 33% of the time (Asch). Current technology is used to submit an answer on your own before hearing others opinions, but still there are no useful solutions to solve this within the classroom.

Now that a student has performed the action of answering the question, the process is then taken to analyze the bridge or evaluation. The gulf of evaluation can be very complex for something as simple as answering a question or contributing to a discussion. First the student must perceive what has happened. The student evaluates if they were told if they were correct, incorrect, if they were validated,  did someone counter what they said, or did something else happen. This is one step that is not truly breaking down in the Seven Stages of Action, but it could still be improved on how a student perceives the result of them answering the question. 

The next stages where the student interprets and compares there is another breakdown in the process. This problem relates to the Social Cognitive Theory in that a student’s knowledge acquisition can be directly influenced by both internal and external environmental factors. These factors include past experiences, social interactions within the class, lack of self-confidence, and more. The Social Cognitive Theory largely emphasises these factors in terms of social experiences to define future social behavior (LaMorte). The way a student interprets what has happened and compares it to their goal state can one again arise a lot of anxiety around if they were validated (Cohen). This creates a negative feedback loop for these students who have discomfort with discussion based learning where their anxious behaviors around speaking to the class contributes to their later past experiences the Social Cognitive Theory refers to.



**Potential Users**

The stakeholders of this problem in regards to our theme of face-to-face instruction include students, professors, and teacher's assistants. This problem is not unique to solely computer science students. It is applicable to students in other disciplines as well. This problem mostly applies to any discussion-based classes for students who might not be as eager to state their opinions comfortably in front of their fellow classmates. This problem affects instructors or teaching assistants in that they might not have full participation from their students if students hold back their opinions. The professor or teaching assistants are the main facilitators of the discussion and look for an easy tool where students can post responses on a topic where their opinions and thoughts can also be viewed by fellow students. The goal is to maximize participation among the students. If the students are provided with the correct tool to make them feel comfortable sharing their original thoughts on an action, this will only inspire better discussion, benefitting both the professors and the students. For example, we use Piazza as an everyday discussion tool in Human Computer Interaction. It allows for students to create a highly customizable response to a prompt in a thread which can include features such as photos, links or other forms of media which might help to get their point across. Other classes might utilize TopHat to include polls in the middle of their presentation or for other means. Overall, both the teachers and the students benefit from a discussion where opinions can flow freely and openly. 

## B. Analysis of Existing Solutions

**Description of Existing Solutions** 

While there are anonymous discussion boards for out of class as far as we know there are no good tools to facilitate live discussion in face-to-face learning. Our problem centers around a lack of good software solutions for facilitating live discussions in class. We believe that existing tools, such as Zoom, Piazza, TopHat and the eLC discussion page are all deficient in some manner in solving this problem. 

For example, with Zoom, we see students are more likely to answer questions in the chat than they do in person so sometimes this discussion can be better in an online setting. Students are able to respond to any questions the professor might ask anonymously. However, even though students do not have to share their identity when using the chat feature, the users can see the other responses in the chat. This might prevent the students from sharing any opinions that might be different from their classmates and eventually encourage conformity. 

Piazza is good for posting anonymously, but it lacks the features to be a live tool to facilitate discussion in an in-person class. Piazza is a main form of communication for questions, comments or concerns, especially in the Computer Science department. The user experience of Piazza has room for improvement in order to be fully functional for in-class discussions. It can be difficult to navigate and at times frustrating for the user.  It is useful for seeing what questions other students have asked in case another student might have the same question. Additionally, it allows both instructors and students to respond to posts, which potentially helps increase response time. Even though we currently use Piazza as a discussion tool in Human-Computer Interaction, we feel that the interface has room for improvement. Piazza has live updates when new posts become available; however, it is annoying for the user in the middle of writing their own post when new posts are being uploaded. If a new post is added from another user on the same thread, Piazza automatically scrolls to the top of the page making the current unfinished post not visible. To the user, it may be unclear what happened to the post they were working on. Additionally, there is a lack of consistency between buttons and links that a user presses to interact with the interface, which causes confusion. Students are also able to see other student’s posts before they post their original thought. This could potentially influence what they already wrote for their post or prevent them from sharing a different opinion. We believe that there should be new software out there which makes it super easy for students and teachers to utilize as a live discussion tool during class where students can feel comfortable sharing their own thoughts and opinions.

Similarly, TopHat is used by professors to deliver powerpoint presentations to students during class. There are several “Poll” type features available that allow for teachers to pose questions and other types of responses to get a general feel for opinions from the class. While this does stimulate student interaction within the class as a whole, it does not actually facilitate discussion. Once students finish the poll, their interaction with the class is over and usually the professors will address the results and move on. There is not an opportunity for students to freely express their opinions and the software itself does not allow a back-and-forth discussion on the current topic. 

The eLC discussion page is a tool used by professors to initiate discussion between students on a relevant class topic outside of the classroom. Students are able to create a post with a response to a prompt, and their fellow students are able to respond with follow up questions or comments. However, this discussion tool on elc does not allow for students to post anonymously. Additionally, it is not a great tool to use for live discussion in the classroom, which is why it is primarily used for assignments to complete outside of the scheduled class time. In order to see new discussion posts, the user has to keep refreshing the page as it does not have live updates.

According to Ben Sneiderman, there are eight “golden rules” to follow for an ideal interface design (Shneiderman). The golden rules include striving for consistency, seeking universal usability, offering informative feedback, designing dialogs (or prompts) to yield closure, preventing errors, permitting easy reversal of actions, keeping users in control, and reduce short-term memory load. Similarly, Don Norman, a notable researcher in Human-Computer Interaction, outlines his Principles of Good Design in his book, “The Design of Everyday Things” (Norman). His principles include discoverability, feedback, a conceptual model, affordances, signifiers, mappings and constraints. Both Sneiderman and Norman believe that computers should not only function correctly, but be easy to use for all users. For the existings in-class discussion tools, some applications attempt to apply these functions for their users, but others fail to acknowledge crucial good design principles. 

Zoom adheres to the principle of Sneiderman’s straight forward design dialogs by making it easy for the user to know they are entering or exiting a meeting. Before a user officially enters a meeting, there will be a prompt that shows whether or not both the microphone and camera are on. It also asks the user if they intend to actually leave the meeting before it officially closes out. Zoom, however, does not allow easy reversal of reactions. Within a Zoom chat, participants cannot take back a comment that was already sent. Additionally,  Zoom has good discoverability because it is clear to the user which features are available through the application. Whether it be wanting to join a video call or respond to a question using the chat feature, zoom contains the proper signifiers which help the user to carry out these goals.

We believe that Piazza lacks in all eight of the Sneiderman’s golden rules. Piazza’s signifiers are inconsistent across the interface. For instance, many action buttons are represented as normal HTML buttons, while others appear as hyperlinks, but they both serve the same function. Piazza also lacks features that address accessibility for all users. The user interface does not offer any sufficient alternatives for the visually impaired, for example. Piazza contains a lot of features for the user to customize their post; however, as previously mentioned, when Piazza is used on highly active threads, it is common for the user to feel as if they have lost control. As Piazza updates, it scrolls back to the top of the page forcing the user to scroll back down to the post they were editing. While piazza is a highly customizable and powerful tool for creating customized posts, an added layer of complexity is added to the users which is not needed for most discussion use cases. Piazza also lacks discoverability. The user interface is not simple for novice users to navigate and lacks the proper signifiers to help guide the user. Piazza is what ultimately inspired us to envision a solution that combines the positives and improves on the negatives of already implemented applications to create a tool that simplifies the interface for easy in-class discussions. 




## C. Proposed Solution

The solution we propose will combine the best parts of many of the aforementioned programs to create a holistic discussion facilitating software. It will be a program that allows instructors to facilitate a discussion, perhaps using on screen prompts or topics, and receive student input that could then also be displayed and discussed in class. With improvements to the interface and tools to facilitate live discussion, we believe that the Seven Stages of Action will not break down. The same goal stands: to get a student to participate in discussion. In the plan phase within the bridge of execution, students will be given time to look at the discussion question(s) and formulate and type some thoughts. This is similar to Piazza where the teacher will write the initial discussion and the students write their response. One property we want to improve from Piazza is the user interface. If students break up into groups, instead of one person typing everything we believe this solution should afford students to all edit the post at the same time. This further allows students to specify what their answers are and allows time to think without the pressure or conformity we described earlier in this document.

The performance of the action is a bit different with the solution we propose. Before, the performing stage involved students or groups volunteering or being chosen to give their answer/opinion of the topic. Many issues arose as we examined the anxiety link to discomfort during class discussion (Cohen). We propose a solution which would afford facilitation of fruitful and low pressure discussion. Students would be able to answer questions or raise points anonymously if they choose, and those posts could be displayed to the class for discussion. These could come from individuals or assigned groups. During the class the instructor would have the ability to select different responses written by students, or topics/prompts they prepared,  to signify what is being discussed. The instructor would also have the ability to withhold posted responses from the students until everyone that wants to respond has submitted. This allows students to have their thoughts formed prior to being chosen and will allow others to wait for validation before they speak up accepting an answer as their own. Moving into the evaluation stage, we would like our solution to encourage students to thoroughly process the material they discuss in class. Hopefully, the experience leaves them feeling like they contributed to the discussion and that they were able to learn from others perspectives. They should be able to view the discussion topics and questions at home and reflect on the class in a meaningful way. They should be able to play through the discussion again, watching in real time as the conversation shifted and different questions were asked and answered. Not only are able to access all of the posts made during class, but are able to walk through the discussion as it evolved. This way, the students can reflect effectively on the main topics of information and have plenty of time to develop their own thoughts about what was talked about in class.    
 

**How can we measure success?**

A measure of success for the implementation of this solution would be measuring an increase in student participation in class discussions and a decrease in student anxiety surrounding discussion based classes. We would like to see students more readily sharing their ideas and finding easier paths to comfortable open discussion. Even if this tool was simply implemented as a way to prepare students for more involved conversation, and they later moved on to un-aided discussion, we would consider it successful.  It would be important to have two different groups when measuring the success of our program. Our control group would be the current guidelines that exist now, with students not having a technical tool to facilitate their live discussion. The experimental group would get to use the program and we would measure the difference in the variables stated above to see if our software is making students more comfortable and live discussion has more participation.
