# MILESTONE 2

In this milestone, we discuss our current problem with evidence to back up claims we make about discussion based classroom participation. This page will first take you through a researched problem defininition and what potential users it effects. We discuss the issues with in class participation within a discussion based class and how students anxiety and lack of validation is not facilitated through any current technologies. We then discribe existing solutions such as Piazza, Tophat, and eLC to explore where they break down in the Seven stages of Action. Lastly, we propose a solution to solve our problem and discuss how we can measure its success.

## A. Task and Problem Definition

**Problem Introduction**

Discussion based classes are prevalent throughout schools and universities and are an effective environment for cultivating learning and the dispersion of ideas. However, these settings do not always afford easy and open communication, and timid students can sometimes struggle to find effective ways to share their thoughts and contribute to the discussion. This can result in uninvolvement or conformity to the ideas of whoever answers first or those who monopolize the conversation, which can lead to an incomplete dialogue and false inflation of certain perspectives. 

The theoretical framework coined with the term “Seven Stages of Action” can be used to help understand human behavior more easily and allows for investigation of where in these seven stages there is a lack within current standards (2). These actions begin with a goal. In the problem stated, contributing to the class discussion is the goal for a student. In the bridge of execution, many steps start to break down and create barriers for the student to execute their goal. There is a positive trend in the relationship between social anxiety and discomfort in a discussion based class with a p-value < 0.001 (3).  

**Potential Users**

The stakeholders of this problem in regards to our theme of face-to-face instruction include students, professors, and teacher's assistants. This problem is not unique to solely computer science students. It is applicable to students in other disciplines as well. This problem mostly applies to any discussion-based classes for students who might not be as eager to state their opinions comfortably in front of their fellow classmates. However, we also think this problem affects instructors or teaching assistants in that they might not have full participation from their students if students hold back their opinions.

## B. Analysis of Existing Solutions

**Description of Existing Solutions** 

While there are anonymous discussion boards for out of class as far as we know there are no good tools to facilitate live discussion in face-to-face learning. Our problem centers around a lack of good software solutions for facilitating live discussions in class. We believe that existing tools, such as Zoom, Piazza, TopHat and the eLC discussion page are all deficient in some manner in solving this problem. 

For example, with Zoom, we see students are more likely to answer questions in the chat than they do in person so sometimes this discussion can be better in an online setting. Students are able to respond to any questions the professor might ask anonymously. However, even though students do not have to share their identity when using the chat feature, the users can see the other responses in the chat. This might prevent the students from sharing any opinions that might be different from their classmates and eventually encourage conformity. 

Piazza is good for posting anonymously, but it lacks the features to be a live tool to facilitate discussion in an in-person class. Piazza is a main form of communication for questions, comments or concerns, especially in the Computer Science department. The user experience of Piazza has room for improvement in order to be fully functional for in-class discussions. It can be difficult to navigate and at times frustrating for the user.  It is useful for seeing what questions other students have asked in case another student might have the same question. Additionally, it allows both instructors and students to respond to posts, which potentially helps increase response time. Even though we currently use Piazza as a discussion tool in Human-Computer Interaction, we feel that the interface has room for improvement. Piazza has live updates when new posts become available; however, it is annoying for the user in the middle of writing their own post when new posts are being uploaded. [need a sentence that explains this annoying part idk how to put it into words]. Additionally, there is a lack of consistency between buttons and links that a user presses to interact with the interface, which causes confusion. Students are also able to see other student’s posts before they post their original thought. This could potentially influence what they already wrote for their post or prevent them from sharing a different opinion. We believe that there should be new software out there which makes it super easy for students and teachers to utilize as a live discussion tool during class where students can feel comfortable sharing their own thoughts and opinions.

Similarly, TopHat is used by professors to deliver powerpoint presentations to students during class. There are several “Poll” type features available that allow for teachers to pose questions and other types of responses to get a general feel for opinions from the class. While this does stimulate student interaction within the class as a whole, it does not actually facilitate discussion. Once students finish the poll, their interaction with the class is over and usually the professors will address the results and move on. There is not an opportunity for students to freely express their opinions and the software itself does not allow a back-and-forth discussion on the current topic. 

The eLC discussion page is a tool used by professors to initiate discussion between students on a relevant class topic outside of the classroom. Students are able to create a post with a response to a prompt, and their fellow students are able to respond with follow up questions or comments. However, this discussion tool on elc does not allow for students to post anonymously. Additionally, it is not a great tool to use for live discussion in the classroom, which is why it is primarily used for assignments to complete outside of the scheduled class time. In order to see new discussion posts, the user has to keep refreshing the page as it does not have live updates.

**Potential Guidelines and Solutions**



## C. Proposed Solution

The solution we propose will be closest to how Piazza works. With improvements to the interface and tools to facilitate live discussion, we believe that the Seven Stages of Action will not break down. The goal is still to get a student to participate in discussion. In the plan phase within the bridge of execution, students will be given time to look at the discussion question(s) and formulate and type some thoughts. 

**How can we measure success?**

The stakeholders of this problem in regards to our theme of face-to-face instruction include students, professors, and teacher's assistants. This problem is not unique to solely computer science students. It is applicable to students in other disciplines as well. This problem mostly applies to any discussion-based classes for students who might not be as eager to state their opinions comfortably in front of their fellow classmates. However, we also think this problem affects instructors or teaching assistants in that they might not have full participation from their students if students hold back their opinions.
